Graph is a non-linear data structure like tree data structure. The limitation of tree is, it can only represent hierarchical data. For situations where nodes or vertices are randomly connected with each other other, we use Graph. Example situations where we use graph data structure are, a social network, a computer network, a network of locations used in GPS and many more examples where different nodes or vertices are connected without any hierarchic or constraint on structure.
